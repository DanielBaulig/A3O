THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT LICENCED UNDER ANY SPECIFIC LICENCE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC YET.

While I propably will choose an open source maybe even copyleft licence I am not
sure on what licence I will choose. Please trespect that I will not grant any
rights to anyone before I am sure on to what licence I will choose for my project.

While you could pull yourself a copy you will most likely not be able to run the 
software because of missing database schemes, data and assets. If you want to see
a current development version live please visit http://www.danielbaulig.de/A3O/
