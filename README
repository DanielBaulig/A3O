THIS SOFTWARE IS NOT LICENCED UNDER ANY SPECIFIC LICENCE TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC YET.

While I propably will choose an open source maybe even copyleft licence I am not
sure on what licence I will choose. Please respect that I will not grant any
rights to anyone before I am settled on what licence I will choose for my project.

While you could pull yourself a copy of this repository you will most likely not 
be able to run the software because of missing database data and assets - and 
because it is heavily under development. If you want to see the latest prototype
live please visit http://www.danielbaulig.de/A3O/ 
While this prototype is pretty much outdated and my current plans point to a more
specialized and streamlined implementation of the rendering frontend it gives a
brief impression on how the frontend might look like in the future.

All assets and (none code) static ressources used in the prototype are included 
in this project but originate from the TripleA project and are licenced under GNU 
GPL. Please refer to http://triplea.sourceforge.net for more information on the 
TripleA project.
